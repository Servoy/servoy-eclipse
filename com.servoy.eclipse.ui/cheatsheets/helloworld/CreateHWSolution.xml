         In Servoy Developer you can manage your solutions through the Solution Explorer. At any moment, if the Solution Explorer is not visible you can make it visible by accessing the Window -&gt; Show View menu and selecting Solution Explorer in the list that shows up. If Solution Explorer is not visible in the list, then click on Others... and you will find it under the Servoy Category.
