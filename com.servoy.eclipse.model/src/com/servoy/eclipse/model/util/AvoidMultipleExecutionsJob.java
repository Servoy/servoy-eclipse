/**
 * A job to execute code that - when it starts to run makes obsolete any other previously scheduled executions of the same code. For example a job that does a full reload of something, if it is
 * scheduled to run 20 times at once, it only needs to run once. If it is scheduled to run N more times while it is already running, it will start executing the code once more only after current execution is done.<br/><br/>
 * Please use {@link #scheduleIfNeeded()} and {@link #runAvoidingMultipleExecutions(IProgressMonitor)} instead of the usual {@link #schedule()} and {@link #run(IProgressMonitor)} when working with this type of jobs.
 *
 * TODO the same need could potentially be made to disappear if you use proper rules for the jobs that want to execute some code - depending on what each situation needs. Rules can be used with this class as well of course.
