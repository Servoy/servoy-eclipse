// import your solution_properties.less here if you want to use less properties of the solution. 
// This solution_properties.less can also include the 'servoy_theme_properties.less' file to have the servoy theme properties also available. but should not include the whole servoy theme
// solution_properties.less is the replacement of the old 'custom_servoy_theme_properties.less' which would include the whole servoy theme and because of that it should not be used in this form.less file
// don't import a less file (like the 'custom_servoy_theme_properties.less') that has a lot of css besides the properties, because this will be included for every form! 
// @import 'solution_properties.less';
