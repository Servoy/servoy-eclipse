// import your solution properties.less here, this solution properties can also include the 'custom_servoy_theme_properties.less' file to have the servoy theme properties also available.
// don't import a less file that has a lot of css besides the properties, because this will be included for every form! Try to only import variables/properties here.
// solution_properties.less is the replacement of the old 'custom_servoy_theme_properties.less' which would include the whole servoy theme and should not be used in this form.less file.
// @import 'solution_properties.less';
